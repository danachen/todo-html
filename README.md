There are three views of the Todo list in this implementation:

- The Todo List Page page contains a list of Todo items and a nav pane for viewing groups of Todo items.
- A mobile device version of the Todo List page that hides the nav pane by default, but allows the user to reveal it by clicking on a responsive hamburger.
- Clicking on the modal opens a dialog box, this allows user add a Todo item.
